This is a step by step guide on how to build a NAS on a Raspberry PI

Here is a solid video to use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMpI8csWis

Things you need:
Raspberry PI 4 with 4gb or 8gb of ram 
SD Card 
SD Card Reader 
USB Harddrive 
Power Supply


Here is a cool kit you can buy that will let you attatch a SATA to your Raspberry PI - https://a.co/d/1UqFhBR


1. Your will want to download the Raspberry Imager and use the Raspberry PI Lite Image for your PI (This will be on the SD Card) 

2. Before you image hit control + X and you can enable SSH and set a password 

3. Once you image the SD Card put it in your PI and then plug everything up (you will want to use ethernet and not WiFi)

4. SSH to the PI using whatever method you can (EX: ssh pi@X.X.X.172)

5. First thing youll want to do is run "sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade" yes you will want to install everything!!!

6. then youll want to install OpenMediaVault using this comman (wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/installScript/master/install | sudo bash)

7. Now you should be able to open a web interface using the same IP that you used to SSH 
  7.1. default creds are username: admin password: openmediavault
  7.2. Go to default settings and change default password

8. Plug USB drive into PI
  8.1. On the webpage go to storage.
  8.2. go to file systems and mount your USB hard drive
  8.3  Create a shared folder using access rights management then click ADD 
  8.4  click apply so you do not lose your progress 

9. Go to services then SMB and enable SMB (if you are using windows)
  9.1. then add your shared folder into the SMB settings

10. Accessing your NAS from Windows
   10.1. You will want to go to your webpage and go to users click on your PI username and give it a password 
   10.2. now you will want to open file explorer (Win + E) 
   10.3. now go to this pc and under network locations right click and select "Add network location" 
   10.4. now enter the path (EX \\192.168.172.1\PIZZA) then hit next and login!

Congrats you now have a NAS on your home network that you can access!
